Linear Regression Feature Selection and Trainer

This is a MATLAB implementation of my existing 
[lin-train](https://github.com/nathanntg/lin-train) feature selection code. It provides
an abstract and iterative approach to selecting features for simple fitting models, such
as linear regression. The training class provides a simple way to do feature selection 
over a large feature space.  The trainer does k-fold cross validation to find features 
that improve validation scores. When complete, the class has the model coefficients as 
well as a score.

More details and documentation coming soon.
